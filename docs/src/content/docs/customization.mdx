## Custom CSS

To customize the styles applied to your Starlight site when using the Starlight Flexoki theme, you can provide additional CSS files to modify or extend the Starlight and Starlight Flexoki theme default styles.

[Learn more about custom CSS in the Starlight documentation.](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles)

## Cascade layers

Like Starlight, the Starlight Flexoki theme uses [cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) internally to manage the order of its styles.
This ensures a predictable CSS order and allows for simpler overrides.
Any custom unlayered CSS will override the default styles from Starlight and the Starlight Flexoki theme.

If you are using cascade layers, you can use [`@layer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) in your [custom CSS](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles) to define the order of precedence for different layers relative to styles from the `starlight` and `flexoki` layers:

```css "starlight" "flexoki"
/* src/styles/custom.css */
@layer my-reset, starlight, flexoki, my-overrides;
```

The example above defines a custom layer named `my-reset`, applied before all the Starlight and Starlight Flexoki theme layers, and another named `my-overrides`, applied after all Starlight and Starlight Flexoki theme layers.
Any styles in the `my-overrides` layer would take precedence over the Starlight and Starlight Flexoki theme styles, but Starlight or the Starlight Flexoki theme could still change styles set in the `my-reset` layer.
